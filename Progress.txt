Progress

-Started with Java Swing. All components will be directly painted onto the screen
-Programmed a GUI to display the game
-Added a ball that moves up in a straight line
-Added a block that disappears when struck and a sound effect that plays when a block 
is struck
-Added a loop that creates a wall of blocks
-Resized and rearranged bricks, added color and point values to bricks, added a paddle
-Added MouseMotionListener for paddle movement. Added text for score, level, and lives
-Added comments and checked block breaking on all blocks
-Refactored  the main class into a game class and added the ability for the ball to
reverse direction after breaking a block
-Started the ball moving at an angle
-Added the ability for the ball to reflect off the left and right wall at a reflected
angle

As we continue to progress, we will work on having the ball bounce off the panel and
the ceiling, changing the angle of the ball depending on where it hits a block, adding 
lives, adding levels, properly accumulating scores, and adding additional sound effects.

We may also work on adding powerups that the player can attain.
